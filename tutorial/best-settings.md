# Best settings!

Here, we'll show you the ideal settings for viewing the "Preview" setting:

***

## Preview Speed

First, open the "Edit" tab, "Settings," and "Preview." The first drag-and-drop setting is 6.0. The default setting is 6.0. Change it to your preferred setting, **but we have some suggestions:**

Speed: 11.0 or 10.5

***

## Normal Preview Zoom

This only changes with the BPM of the song, or whatever you think is best, my setting is 2.3x or 2.5x
